# Smart_Retention
CEE 4800 Final Project - Modeling Smart Retention Basins

This code can be used to model any retention basin of any size using regional precipitation data. It evaluates the benefit of implementing 
a smart retention basin system that uses a water level sensor and pump to intelligently manage stormwater in the event of a large precitpitaton event. It compares this system to a null model that only uses a weir to control outflow.

This code is specifically run on Washington Park lake in Albany, NY
